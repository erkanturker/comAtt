## Capstone II Project Idea - Erkan Turker

1. **Community School Attendance App:**  The app will assist in managing community school attendance. Admin can create terms (like '2024 Summer'), classes, and schedule classes within each term. The teacher will take the attendance of the class that they are assigned.  It will display attendance rates for the term, month, and weekday for each class or the entire organization. This app is solely focused on taking attendance. The admin will create students, classes, terms, and teachers. However, over time, it will evolve into a student management app for private organizations.
